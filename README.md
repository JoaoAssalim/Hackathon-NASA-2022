Our Idea is create and software to analyze and tell the farmer if it's a good day to plat your food, or if forecasts say there will be frost, snow or high temperatures, so the farmer plant or wait a few days to do it. And for that, we need to analyze weather forecasts and possible changes in temperatures or possible frosts, because many foods do not support this change, and with that they end up being lost, so we have the idea of an application that analyzes the area and gives feedback whether it would be a good time to plant this certain food. <br>
